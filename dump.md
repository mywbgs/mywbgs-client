# Todo
1. Move all screens over to components with classes. Take the following example: the HomeworkEdit page autogenerates the subjects it thinks are relevant, but then the next time the user interacts with the page time has passed and the items change. This is _not_ good
2. Use ```utils.getPassedPeriods``` and a bunch of other functions I just wrote
3. https://github.com/reactjs/reselect
4. CSRF?
5. Login router in API should return 200 even if password and username incorrect (errors being thrown in console)
6. On Monday morning (possibly all mornings?) there are no autocomplete suggestions on the new homework form :/
7. Move bulk of logic from editLoad to editHomework
